It might crash, it might lag, and it's barely balanced!

There are several Lua hacks to make things work, and bugs.

## Repository structure
`lua` folder - Contains any scripts for running Renegade 2D. The script is mod-agnostic; it works for the CNC & RA mods, and can easily support future mods.

`mods/{mod}/rules` folder - Contains mod-specific rules for Renegade 2D

`mods/{mod}/maps` folder - Contains mod-specific maps for Renegade 2D

The maps in the `mods/{mod}/maps` folder only contain minimal custom yaml for Renegade 2D (player & team settings only).

## Building maps
To build maps for development, please see and use the `build-maps.ps1` script.
